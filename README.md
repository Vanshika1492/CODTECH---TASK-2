OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: Finite State Machine(FSM) Design

![122](https://github.com/Vanshika1492/CODTECH---TASK-2/assets/174045085/d40e6589-0d27-4505-85fa-154a97c83abc)




Objective: The objective of this task is to design Finite State Machines (FSMs) using Verilog or VHDL within a VLSI software environment. This includes writing testbenches to thoroughly test various states and transitions of the FSM. Additionally, the task involves simulating the FSM's behavior to ensure its correctness and functionality.

Key Activities:
1. Design: Design the FSM using Verilog or VHDL.
2. Testbench Development: Write testbenches to test different states and transitions.
3. Simulation: Simulate the FSM in a VLSI software environment.
4. Verification: Verify the FSM's correctness and functionality.

Technologies Used:
1. Verilog or VHDL
2. VLSI Software Tools (e.g., ModelSim, Synopsys VCS, Xilinx Vivado, Cadence).
3. Testbench Frameworks in Verilog or VHDL.
4. Verification Tools (e.g., waveform viewers, debugging tools).
